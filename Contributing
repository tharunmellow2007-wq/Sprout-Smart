## 🔧 Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Virtual environment tool

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sproutsmart.git
cd sproutsmart

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies

# Run tests
pytest tests/
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```python
# Good
def classify_waste_material(image_path, model):
    """
    Classify waste material from uploaded image.
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): Path to the image file
        model: Pre-trained CNN model
        
    Returns:
        dict: Classification results with confidence scores
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Use meaningful variable names
waste_type = "plastic_bottle"
confidence_score = 0.95

# Add comments for complex logic
# Calculate size based on pixel dimensions and assumed distance
estimated_size = calculate_dimensions(image_data)
```

### Code Formatting

We use **Black** for code formatting:

```bash
# Format your code
black src/

# Check formatting
black --check src/
```

### Linting

We use **Flake8** for linting:

```bash
# Run linter
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=100
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints where possible:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def get_plant_recommendations(
    waste_size: float,
    climate: str,
    region: str
) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
    """Get plant recommendations based on parameters."""
    pass
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from src.models import WasteClassifier

def test_waste_classification():
    """Test waste material classification."""
    classifier = WasteClassifier()
    result = classifier.classify("test_images/bottle.jpg")
    
    assert result['category'] == 'plastic_bottle'
    assert result['confidence'] > 0.8

def test_plant_recommendation():
    """Test plant recommendation engine."""
    # Test implementation
    pass
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_classifier.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## 📚 Documentation

### Code Documentation

Use clear docstrings:

```python
def generate_farming_structure(waste_type: str, farming_method: str) -> dict:
    """
    Generate farming structure design based on waste and method.
    
    This function uses cGAN to create practical designs for different
    farming methods (soil-based, hydroponics, aeroponics) using the
    provided waste material.
    
    Args:
        waste_type (str): Type of waste material (e.g., 'plastic_bottle')
        farming_method (str): Farming method ('soil', 'hydro', 'aero')
        
    Returns:
        dict: Structure design with dimensions and instructions
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If waste_type or farming_method is invalid
        
    Example:
        >>> design = generate_farming_structure('plastic_bottle', 'hydro')
        >>> print(design['instructions'])
    """
    pass
```
